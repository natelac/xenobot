  - Remove movies/seasons of shows that go unwatched
  - Track when movies are created, when they are last watched, and how many people have watched it
  - Weight time to removal by how many people have watched it
  - Start a poll in discord on whether or not the movie should be removed
    - Have two reactions, one for keep and one for remove
    - If nobody votes keep, get rid of it
    - If anyone votes keep, weight how much longer it gets to stay by how many vote keep
    - If people are voting keep and remove, weight how much longer it stays by the ratio of the vote
      - This could be a bit toxic, but the idea is that there is limited space, so people are voting for how to distribute the space
    - Contested movies should be voted on sooner than uncontested movies, so that the bot doesn't spam.
- Get a backup system working
